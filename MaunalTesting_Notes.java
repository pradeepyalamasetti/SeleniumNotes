1. What is Manual Testing?
Ans. Manual Testing is a kind of software testing in which a software tester develops and executes the test cases without using any automated testing tools.
     
2. What tool is used for Manual Testing?
Ans. Manual testing tools such as Bugzilla, JIRA, JMeter, and many more.
     
3. What is the Advantage of Manual Testing?
Ans. 1.Manual testing can be done on all kinds of applications.
     2.Application must be tested manually before it is automated.
     3.It allows tester to perform adhoc testing.
     4.It is preferred in the projects where the requirements change frequently and for the products where the GUI changes constantly.
     
4. What are the disadvantages of Manual testing?
Ans. 1.time-consuming
     2.More number of human resource are required.
     3.Repeating the same task again and again is almost impossiable.
     
5. Will manual testing end in the future?
Ans. 
     
6. What is Regression Testing?
Ans. Regression testing is the process of retesting the software apllication to ensure that new code changes have not affected existing functioanlities.
     
7. How do you decide on test cases for the regression suite?
Ans. 
     
8. How do you find the regression scenarios if a defect is fixed?
Ans. By Requirement Traceability Matrix is used for the impact analysis. RTM tells you the relationship between the features.
     Once you had done retesting after a bug fixes, you need to identify the other affected areas then execute their test cases. 
     Similarly, once there is a new feature added check the affected area and execute the already written test cases for the affected areas.
     
9. You have 20 bugs, and you need to fix them as well as you need to run the regression. You are the only
   two people in a team. How will you do it, and which one will you prioritise?
     
10. Difference between Regression and retesting?
Ans. Regression:
     1.It is know as generic testing.
     2.Regression testing is the process of retesting the software apllication to ensure that new code changes have not affected existing functioanlities.
     3.It takes more time in performing regression testing as it explore the whole application.
     Re-testing:
     1.It is know as planned testing.
     2.Testing again and again to make sure the defect has been fixed or not.
     3.It take less time as it focus only on defect of the application.
     
11. If you have a situation like need to execute all test cases under the project for regression before
release, how you can manage the situation?
Ans.
